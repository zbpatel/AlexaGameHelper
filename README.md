# AlexaGameHelper
Skill for Amazon Alexa that provides a suite of functions that help with running board games.

The majority of this code is run on AWS Lambda, but I also included the sample utterances and intent schema that are put on the Alexa platform so that the code is easier to read. 

I initially wrote this in python, but eventually, I might try to rewrite it in Node.JS for the experience.
